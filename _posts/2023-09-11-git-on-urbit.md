Git version control system has come to underpin virtually all of software development. 
Platforms like Github, Gitlab and others provide software development collaboration 
interfaces used daily by programmers around the world. 
(The statistics are astounding: around 100 million programmers use Github daily, 
and over 90 out of Fortune 100 companies use Github as their software development platform.) 
Although Git itself can be used as a collaboration tool with only email communication, 
Git web interfaces are overwhelmingly preferred, with few exceptions of high-profile projects, 
such as, unsurprisingly, the Linux kernel (for which Git was originally written) and Git itself, 
whose development is to date conducted exclusively over email.

Thus, although Git technically supports decentralized workflows, 
in practice use of centralized platforms becomes indispensable because of collaboration features they provide. 
It is easy to understand this dynamics -- building software involves much that is simply 
not captured by Git. Submission of issues, pull requests and their collaborative integration, 
code exploration and review -- all of which are made accessible through a convenient interface.
